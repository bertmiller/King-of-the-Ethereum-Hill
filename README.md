# King-of-the-Ethereum-Hill
A simple king of the hill game powered by Ethereum written in Solidity.  

# Testing
A sample (and very simple) HTML page and corresponding javascript is provided.  These won't work unless you run the contracts and point index.js to the right contract address.  You can do this two ways, either run a smart contract on Ethereum or test using a private test blockchain like testrpc & truffle.  Files to test with truffle are included in /test.
